# zen-air-bells
An autogenerated zen air bells meditation sound that you can set to a specific time.
It will begin and end with a recognisable, pleasant sound.

It won´t get too boring, because of chord changes, not too interesting, because the chord changes aren´t very often.
And the chords are chosen to be open, hanging.. And lower notes are more probable than higher ones.
For the gong sound I used a dual sine wave with a slight frequency difference.
And for this "instrument" I made 16 polyfonic registers.
With some tweaking, you´ll get different instruments or chords, happy modding.

## Settings
I had to create some settings, since people noticed the phones and tablets shut off after a while.
There is now a NO-SLEEP setting, using the nosleep.js library.
At least.. there will be tonight.

## Further developments include:
 - More tuning options
 - white, brown, pink etc noise integration (requires some research on my part). I would like to generate non-looping running water, fire or rain sounds.
 - visualisations?
