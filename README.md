# zen-air-bells
A autogenerated zen air bells meditation sound that you can set to a specific time.
It won´t get too boring, because of chord changes, not too interesting, because the chord changes aren´t very often.
And the chords are chosen to be open, hanging.. And lower notes are more probable than higher ones.
For the gong sound I used a dual sine wave with a slight frequency difference.
And for this "instrument" I made 16 polyfonic registers.
With some tweaking, you´ll get different instruments or chords, happy modding.
